Go Logging that just works

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/DataDrake/waterlog)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/DataDrake/waterlog) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DataDrake/waterlog.svg)]()

## Motivation
Logging is terribly boring, but can be an important part of a project. 
This library provides logging capabilities that attempt to "spice up"
what is otherwise a very utilitarian aspect of programming.

### Goals
* Styling that is easy to look at
* More granular logging severities ("levels")
* Compatibility with the existing ```log.Logger``` interface

## Implementation
Waterlog consists of two sets of code. The first is an implementation
in Go which is able to be used as a drop-in replacement for the Go
```log.Logger```. The second is a set of Makefile definitions that
provide similar styling for GNU Make project.
